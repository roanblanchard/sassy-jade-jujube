      So it's really hard to talk about yourself, right? Yeah definitely!

      I was born in Seattle, WA, but my family moved out here to the Triangle when I was very young - way too young to remember Seattle. I lived here in Durham until 2017 when I moved to Asheville with my then girlfriend now wife. Hannah and I got married in the summer of 2019 and went on a honeymoon in Brooklyn, NYC which was awesome to say the least! We moved back to Durham this past year (if moving wasn't stressful enough, try moving in a pandemic!!)

      Here are some of our wedding pictures! We had a really small non-traditional wedding at the courthouse.

      I graduated from AB Tech in Asheville with an Associate's in Science in Brewing, Distillation, and Fermentation in May of last year which immediately became useless to me because of Coronavirus since a lot of breweries either stopped hiring or shut down completely. Since I was home a lot, I picked up coding as a hobby and haven't put it down since!

      During college, I focused mainly on the laboratory responsibilities in a brewery. This meant that I worked a lot with yeast and bacteria; it was a lot of fun! I did my final project on a wild yeast that I cultivated and then selectively bred to be used for fermenting commercial hard cider. Here are some cool pictures of yeast and bacteria I worked with!

      My main interests outside of coding consist of video games (Kerbal Space Program, Breath of the Wild, Sid Meier's Civilization V, and Rocket League), cooking/baking, coffee (we just got an espresso machine and it is my pride and joy), and making music (mostly sample-based electronic but it's not great seriously).

      Also, we have two pet rats! Their names are Beans and Rice; they're a little over a year old now. They have a lot of energy but they're sweethearts :)

      I'm really excited to make software engineering my career. I've had so much fun with it from the very beginning and I feel lucky I have this opportunity to do it as my job in the future!! :)
